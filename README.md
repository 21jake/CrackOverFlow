# CrackOverFlow
This project is inspired by, you might guess, Stack OverFlow. The backend is developed with Laravel and frontend is with React-Redux.

This is a solo project. I tried to cover the most basic functionalities of the sites: Authorization, posts, comments (CRUD), upvote and search. Styling might be improved and if you attempt to find bugs, you will see lotta them :).

Shoutout to my mentors Tuan Doan (https://github.com/tuan1412/) and Duc BQ (https://github.com/buiquangduc) for making this project possible.
